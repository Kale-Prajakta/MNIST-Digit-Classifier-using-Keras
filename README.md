# MNIST Digit Classifier using Keras

This project demonstrates a basic neural network implemented using **Keras** (TensorFlow backend) to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST** dataset. It covers core concepts in deep learning and an introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the basics of neural networks: activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.
- Build and train a dense neural network using Keras.
- Visualize training performance with loss curves.
- Evaluate model performance using a confusion matrix.
- Apply basic CNN layers for improved image classification.
